# Streamix: Kafka + Trino + GraphQL

## Introduction
Welcome to Streamix, an innovative integration of Kafka, GraphQL, and Trino. This project aims to harness the real-time data streaming capabilities of Kafka, the flexibility of GraphQL, and the powerful querying capabilities of Trino (formerly known as Presto).

## Features
- **Kafka**: Leverage real-time data streaming and processing.
- **Trino**: Utilize distributed SQL query engine for big data analytics.
- **GraphQL**: Create flexible and efficient data queries and APIs.

## Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or later
- Node.js and npm (for GraphQL)

## Setup and Installation
1. **Kafka Setup**:
   - Follow the instructions in the `/kafka` directory to set up Kafka brokers and Zookeeper.

2. **Trino Setup**:
   - Set up Trino by following the guidelines in the `/trino` directory.

3. **GraphQL Setup**:
   - Instructions for setting up the GraphQL interface are available in the `/apollo` directory.

## Usage
1. **Kafka**:
    - Produce and consume messages through Kafka topics.
2. **Trino**:
    - Run SQL queries over your Kafka streams and other data sources.
3. **GraphQL**:
    - Use the GraphQL endpoint to query data in real-time.


## Configuration
- Configuration files for each component can be found in their respective directories. Customize them as per your needs.
