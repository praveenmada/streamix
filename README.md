# Streamix: Kafka + GraphQL + Presto

## Introduction
Welcome to Streamix, an innovative integration of Kafka, GraphQL, and Presto. This project aims to harness the real-time data streaming capabilities of Kafka, the flexibility of GraphQL, and the powerful querying capabilities of Presto.

## Features
- **Kafka**: Leverage real-time data streaming and processing.
- **GraphQL**: Create flexible and efficient data queries and APIs.
- **Presto**: Utilize distributed SQL query engine for big data analytics.

## Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or later
- Node.js and npm (for GraphQL)

## Setup and Installation
1. **Kafka Setup**:
   - Follow the instructions in the `/kafka` directory to set up Kafka brokers and Zookeeper.

2. **GraphQL Setup**:
   - Instructions for setting up the GraphQL interface are available in the `/apollo` directory.

3. **Presto Setup**:
   - Set up Presto by following the guidelines in the `/presto` directory.

## Usage
1. **Kafka**:
  - Produce and consume messages through Kafka topics.
2. **GraphQL**:
  - Use the GraphQL endpoint to query data in real-time.
3. **Presto**:
  - Run SQL queries over your Kafka streams and other data sources.

## Configuration
- Configuration files for each component can be found in their respective directories. Customize them as per your needs.
